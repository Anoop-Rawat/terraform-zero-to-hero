# Vault Integration

Here are the detailed steps for each of these steps:

## Create an AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu or we can use WSL(Windows sub system for linux)

To create an AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu, you can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Here are the steps involved in creating an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console:

- Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
- Click on the Launch Instance button.
- Select the Ubuntu Server xx.xx LTS AMI.
- Select the instance type that you want to use.
- Configure the instance settings.
- Click on the Launch button.

## Install Vault on the EC2 instance or on WSL

To install Vault on the EC2 instance, you can use the following steps:

**Install gpg**

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gpg
```

**Download the signing key to a new keyring**

```
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
```
Enter file name : enter the signing key file name


**Verify the key's fingerprint**

```
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint
```

**Add the HashiCorp repo**

```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

```
sudo apt update
```

**Finally, Install Vault**

```
sudo apt install vault
```

## Start Vault.

To start Vault, you can use the following command:

```
vault server -dev -dev-listen-address="0.0.0.0:8200"
```
Keep this server running and open new ubuntu server window and run below command (Note: Run below command where your signing key file exist)

export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'

You can now access vault UI using public IP or Private IP address
To get Private IP run command :   hostname -I

Open in browser : 172.21.184.9:8200

Login with Root Token 
Root Token will be available on previous server window where you have started vault on dev environment



## Configure Terraform to read the secret from Vault.

Detailed steps to enable and configure AppRole authentication in HashiCorp Vault:

1. **Enable AppRole Authentication**:

To enable the AppRole authentication method in Vault, you need to use the Vault CLI or the Vault HTTP API.

A. Create Policy:

First of all, we need to create a vault policy: Below code will create policy named as terraform: There is no need to provide the access to all the path which is mentioned in below policy, we can mention only for which we want to provide the access.

vault policy write terraform - <<EOF
path "*" {
  capabilities = ["list", "read"]
}

path "secrets/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}

path "kv/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}


path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}

path "auth/token/create" {
capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "list"]
}
EOF

B. Create role : Run below command

Before create a role, need to create access authentication method in Vauil using UI as given below:

Goto vault UI > Access > Enable new method > Generic AppRole> Click Enable Method 

Now run below command in server terminal:

vault write auth/approle/role/terraform \
    secret_id_ttl=10m \
    token_num_uses=10 \
    token_ttl=20m \
    token_max_ttl=30m \
    secret_id_num_uses=40 \
    token_policies=terraform



3. **Generate Role ID and Secret ID**:

After creating the AppRole, you need to generate a Role ID and Secret ID pair. The Role ID is a static identifier, while the Secret ID is a dynamic credential.

**a. Generate Role ID**:

You can retrieve the Role ID using the Vault CLI:

```bash
vault read auth/approle/role/my-approle/role-id # change my-approle to terraform as per role name created above

```

Save the Role ID for use in your Terraform configuration.

**b. Generate Secret ID**:

To generate a Secret ID, you can use the following command:

```bash
vault write -f auth/approle/role/my-approle/secret-id
   ```

This command generates a Secret ID and provides it in the response. Save the Secret ID securely, as it will be used for Terraform authentication.
