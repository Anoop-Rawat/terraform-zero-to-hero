DRIFT DETECTION

Drift detection in Terraform refers to the process of identifying discrepancies between the desired state and the actual state of infrastructure. 

Drift occurs when changes are made outside of Terraform, such as manual updates via cloud consoles or modifications by other automation tools.


Drift detection is crucial because:
- Prevents Configuration Mismatches – Ensures infrastructure remains as intended.
- Enhances Security – Detects unauthorized changes that could introduce vulnerabilities.
- Improves Compliance – Helps maintain regulatory standards by tracking unexpected modifications.
- Reduces Operational Risks – Prevents unexpected failures due to untracked changes.
- Optimizes Costs – Identifies unintended resource modifications that may increase expenses.
